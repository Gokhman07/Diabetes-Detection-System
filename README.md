The scale of diabetes problem is also important to recognize. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has indicated that as of 2018, 34.2 million Americans have diabetes and 88 million have prediabetes. Furthermore, the CDC estimates that 1 in 5 diabetics, and roughly 8 in 10 prediabetics are unaware of their risk. While there are different types of diabetes, type II diabetes is the most common form and its prevalence varies by age, education, income, location, race, and other social determinants of health. Much of the burden of the disease falls on those of lower socioeconomic status as well. Diabetes also places a massive burden on the economy, with diagnosed diabetes costs of roughly 327 billion dollars and total costs with undiagnosed diabetes and prediabetes approaching 400 billion dollars annuall.

The Diabetes Detection System is a software project designed to analyze personal details and determine if an individual is at risk of or potentially diagnosed with diabetes. This system utilizes data-driven algorithm and machine learning techniques to evaluate various personal factors and provide insights into the individual's likelihood of being affected by diabetes.
